# Waitlist Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate your Aptura waitlist form with Google Sheets.

## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. Updated Files

#### `pages/Contact.tsx`
- ✅ Added async form submission handler
- ✅ Added POST request to Google Apps Script endpoint
- ✅ Added loading state (`isSubmitting`)
- ✅ Added error handling and error message display
- ✅ Added disabled states for form fields during submission
- ✅ Added "Submitting..." button state

**What you need to do**: Update the `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` constant with your deployed Web App URL

### 2. New Files Created

#### `google-apps-script/` directory
Contains all the Google Apps Script code and documentation:

- **`waitlist-handler.gs`** - Complete Apps Script code (copy to Google Sheet)
- **`QUICK_START.md`** - 5-minute setup guide
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive instructions
- **`README.md`** - Directory overview

## 🚀 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Deploy the Google Apps Script
1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/xxxxx/edit
2. Go to **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
3. Copy the code from `google-apps-script/waitlist-handler.gs`
4. Paste it into the Apps Script editor
5. Click **Deploy** → **New deployment** → **Web app**
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"
6. **Copy the Web App URL** (you'll need this next)

### Step 2: Update Your Website Code
1. Open `pages/Contact.tsx`
2. Find line 4:
   ```typescript
   const APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace `'YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE'` with your actual Web App URL from Step 1

### Step 3: Deploy Your Website
```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy to your hosting service
```

### Step 4: Test
1. Visit https://www.apturapm.com/#/contact
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Check your Google Sheet to verify the data appeared

## 📊 How It Works

```
User visits https://www.apturapm.com/#/contact
              ↓
Fills out waitlist form (name, email, role, units)
              ↓
Clicks "Get Early Access"
              ↓
Contact.tsx sends POST request to Google Apps Script
              ↓
Apps Script appends data to Google Sheet
              ↓
User sees success message: "You're on the list!"
```

## 📋 Form Data Mapping

| Form Field | Variable | Google Sheet Column |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| Full Name | `name` | Full_Name (A) |
| Email Address | `email` | Email_Address (B) |
| I am a... | `role` | Role (C) |
| How many units | `units` | Number_Units (D) |
| (automatic) | - | Timestamp (E) |

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ Form uses HTTPS for secure transmission
- ✅ Only sheet owner can access the data
- ✅ Script runs with your permissions
- ✅ All submissions are logged
- ✅ No data stored client-side

## 🧪 Testing Locally

To test before deploying to production:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173/#/contact and submit the form. The data should appear in your Google Sheet.

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting:
- **Quick Setup**: `google-apps-script/QUICK_START.md`
- **Full Guide**: `google-apps-script/SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Directory Info**: `google-apps-script/README.md`

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Made

1. **Loading State**: Button shows "Submitting..." during form submission
2. **Disabled Fields**: Form fields are disabled while submitting
3. **Error Handling**: Red error banner displays if submission fails
4. **Success Message**: Existing success page shows after submission
5. **Accessibility**: All states respect disabled styling

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Form submits but no data in sheet"
- Verify you updated the `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in `Contact.tsx`
- Check the URL ends with `/exec`
- Look at Apps Script execution logs for errors

### "Script authorization error"
- Open Apps Script editor
- Run the `testSubmission` function
- Complete the authorization flow

### "CORS errors in browser console"
- This is expected with `no-cors` mode
- The form will still work correctly
- The data will save to the sheet
